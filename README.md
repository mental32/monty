## Brief

Monty `(/ˈmɒntɪ/)` is an attempt to provide a completely organic dialect of
Python equipped with a stronger, safer, and smarter type system.

At a high level monty can be closely compared with what TypeScript does for the
JavaScript community. The core contrast between Monty and TypeScript however is
that TS is a strict syntactical superset of JS, Monty is a strict syntactical
subset of Python; meaning that TS adds backwards incompatible syntax to JS
where Monty disallows existing Python syntax and semantics in a backwards
compatible manner.
